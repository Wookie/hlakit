GCC has a pattern for specifying targets using a "triplet" like so:

cpu-company-system

where system can have the form of:

os
kernel-os

Since a lot of the machines targetted by HLAKit don't have an OS, we will be
extending the target triplet so that system can also be:

machine
machine-variant

Where the difference between machines is anything hardware specific.  A perfect
example of this is the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).  The CPU in the NES
is a Mos Technologies 6502 with some custom modifications (missing BCD, memory
mapped registers, and polling).  There are also two variants of the CPU, one
for NTSC markets and one for PAL markets.  The PAL chip has a different clock
divider to get the 50Hz refresh rate for PAL instead of the 60Hz for NTSC. So,
what is the triplet for the NES machines?  The answer is:

mos6502-nintendo-nes-ntsc
mos6502-nintendo-nes-pal

When HLAKit runs, the selection of "nintendo", "nes" and "ntsc" will tell
HLAKit to use the Ricoh 2A0X CPU definition instead of the base 6502 CPU
definition and in the NES system library, the clock divider constant will be
set to 60Hz.  If instead "pal" was specified, the only difference is that the
clock divider will be set to 50Hz in the NES system library.

So what are all of the target triplets for the systems HLAKit plans to support?
