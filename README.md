HLAKit -- A High Level Assembler Toolkit
========================================

Version 0.8.0
Copyright (C) 2010 Dave Huseby <dave@linuxprogrammer.org>

HLAKit is based on and inspired by the NESHLA project by Brian Provinciano.  He
created an awesome NES-specific high level assembly (HLA) language that makes
writing NES games much easier than wrangling the cc65 toolchain or any other
NES toolchain out there.

The goal of HLAKit is to create an easily extensible high level assembler
toolkit that supports as many old game consoles as possible.  The high level 
assembly language that the front end parses is derived from the high level 
assembly that NESHLA supported and is mostly exactly the same.  It has been
extended to allow for more cpu and platform specific extensions and to
make processor specific assembly mnemonics easily switchable.
